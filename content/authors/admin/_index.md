Hello,I am Haoran Pan,a bioinformatics enthusiasts and a devotee of Python/R. My Life motto is: Progress is the activity of today and the assurance of tomorrow.

I use my knowledge of Python, R and shell to solve problems in bioinformatics such as genome assembly of simple diploids/complex polyploids, comparative genomics, 3D genomics, and epigenomics.
